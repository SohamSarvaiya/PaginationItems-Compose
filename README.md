Pagination in Jetpack Compose


This project demonstrates the implementation of pagination in Jetpack Compose using the latest Android development practices. The app efficiently loads items in chunks and supports smooth scrolling with dynamic data loading.

Features:

Jetpack Compose: Built using the modern UI toolkit for Android.

Default Paginator: A reusable and customizable pagination logic class.

ViewModel Integration: Manages UI state and handles business logic.

Repository Pattern: Ensures clean separation of concerns and scalable architecture.

Coroutines: Handles asynchronous data loading for optimal performance.

Dynamic Pagination: Initially loads 20 items, and fetches the next 20 as the user scrolls.

This example is a great starting point for anyone looking to implement scroll-based data loading in a Compose-based application.
